<h1>Issues with FAST Linked Data API</h1>

<ul>
    <li>The documentation is very poor. It contains many missing pieces and errors.</li>
    <li>There is no reference code samples (like there is for the assignFAST API).</li>
    <li>I sent in a request for code samples using their feedback form a few weeks ago
    and never got any reply.</li>
    <li>The API page itself says the API is still experimental so I would hesitate to use it in production.</li>
    <li>The biggest problem is that the results returned by the search call are not the most popular.
        They seem really obscure.</li>
</ul>
